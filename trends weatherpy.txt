The highest maximum temperatures are indeed concentrated at the equator.
The max temperatures decrease more rapidly as the latitude increases than when the latitude decreases.
While wind speed is for the most part consistent across latitudes, the highest windspeeds are occurring in the far northern latitudes. 
Humidity and cloudiness do not have significant changes dependent on latitude.
